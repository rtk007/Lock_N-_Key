        <p>Hi everyone,</p>

        <p>I want to clarify the current status of Lock-N-Key.</p>

        <p>This project began as a personal learning exercise to explore ideas around local security tools. It was never
            intended to be a commercial product or a mass-distributed security solution. I shared an early build to
            gather feedback and learn from different technical perspectives.</p>

        <p>Through discussions and feedback, I realized that my build and packaging process was not yet structured or
            transparent enough for a security-focused application. Even experimental tools in this space require a
            higher level of verification and reproducibility than I had in place.</p>

        <p>Because of that realization, I have decided to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Remove all installer and executable files from my GitHub</li>
            <li>Stop sharing compiled versions of the application through this website</li>
            <li>Keep only the concept and source code available for educational purposes</li>
            <li>Take time to properly learn secure development and reproducible build practices before sharing binaries
                again</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This project remains part of my learning journey as a developer. I did not intend to create harm or mislead
            anyone, but I take responsibility for not recognizing the risks in how I shared early builds.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the people who raised concerns and asked important questions — that feedback helped me improve
            my approach and understanding.</p>
